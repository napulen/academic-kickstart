The `master` branch of this repository should always point to the latest `master` of the original repo.

If cloning for the first time, add the remote to the original repo:

```bash
git remote add original https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git
```

The `napulen.github.io` branch of this repository has the changes introduced for generating the website at https://napulen.github.io and it is the default branch

# Migration to newer version of academic

When migrating to a newer version of the `academic` repository.

Sync this `master` and get it up to date

```bash
git checkout master
git pull original master
```

While on that branch, build the newest version of `academic` and make sure it works

```
hugo server
```

Check http://localhost:1313

# Render the full example from academic instead of minimal

The `academic` submodule (`themes/academic`) provides a full demo of the website with several sections and entries.

The version rendered by `academic-kickstart`, however, is minimal.

In order to get the full example working on master, create symbolic links to the example site of `themes/academic`.
